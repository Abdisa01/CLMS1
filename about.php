		<h3>Mission</h3>
            <p style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:17px;">
Class type architecture provides a strategy for layering the classes of the system to distribute the functionality of the software among classes. Furthermore, class type architectures provide guidance as to what other types of classes a given type of class will interact with, and how that interaction will occur. This increases the maintainability and portability of the system

This section consists of the design goals and proposed system model. Functional requirements are grouped in such a way that they could be constructed as sub systems and the non-functional requirements defined in the analysis are transformed into design goals.
